# Python-Folium-Web-Mapping
Map Visualization with Folium

Folium is a library that uses JavaScript leaflet.js module in the background and it enables interactive map visualizations in Python.
It has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys and supports both Image, Video, GeoJSON and TopoJSON overlays.


In the attached jupyter notebook I have created multiple map style layers along with couple of marker style layers with custom pop up, geojson country borders and minimap.

Combination examples are given on the pictures below. 

Download the files, run jupyter notebook and turn on/off desired layers and map styles.
